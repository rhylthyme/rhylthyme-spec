## Schema Structure

The Rhylthyme schema defines programs as JSON objects with the following key components:

### Program-Level Properties

- **`programId`** (required): Unique identifier for the program
- **`name`** (required): Human-readable name
- **`description`**: Detailed description
- **`version`**: Program version number (should match schema version)
- **`environmentType`**: Type of environment (e.g., 'kitchen', 'laboratory')
- **`actors`**: Number of available workers/operators
- **`tracks`** (required): Array of parallel execution tracks
- **`resourceConstraints`** (required): Resource usage limits
- **`startTrigger`**: How the program begins execution

### Example: Restaurant Breakfast Service

```json
{
  "programId": "restaurant-breakfast",
  "name": "Restaurant Breakfast Service",
  "description": "Professional restaurant breakfast service workflow with coordinated cooking and plating",
  "version": "0.1.0-alpha",

### Example: Bacon Cooking Track

```json
{
  "trackId": "bacon",
  "name": "Bacon",
  "description": "Multiple orders of bacon",
  "batch_size": 2,
  "steps": [
    {
      "stepId": "bacon-prep",
      "name": "Prepare Bacon",
      "description": "Place bacon strips in cold pan",
      "task": "prep-work",
      "trigger": {

        "type": "fixed",
        "seconds": 60
      }
    },
    {
      "stepId": "bacon-cook",
      "name": "Cook Bacon",
      "description": "Cook bacon, flipping occasionally until crispy",
      "trigger": {
        "on": "bacon-prep"
      },
      "duration": {
        "type": "variable",
        "minSeconds": 480,
        "maxSeconds": 720,
        "defaultSeconds": 600,
        "triggerName": "bacon-done"
      },
      "task": "stove-burner"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step Structure

Steps are the individual work units within a track. They define what work is done, how long it takes, and when it starts.

### Step Properties

- **`stepId`** (required): Unique identifier
- **`name`** (required): Human-readable name
- **`description`**: Detailed description
- **`task`**: Resource/tool required for this step
- **`trigger`** (required): When this step begins
- **`duration`** (required): How long the step takes
- **`resources`**: Array of required resources
- **`flex`**: Whether this step can expand to fill available time

### Trigger Types

#### 1. Program Start
```json
{
  "type": "programStart"
}
```
Step begins immediately when the program starts.

#### 2. On Another Step (Simplified Syntax)
```json
{
  "on": "eggs-crack-whisk"
}
```
Step begins when the specified step completes.

#### 3. On Step with Offset
```json
{
  "on": "eggs-crack-whisk",
  "offsetSeconds": 30
}
```
Step begins 30 seconds after the specified step completes.

#### 4. On Step Start Event
```json
{
  "on": "eggs-crack-whisk",
  "event": "start"
}
```
Step begins when the specified step starts (not when it completes).

#### 5. Manual Trigger
```json
{
  "type": "manual",
  "triggerName": "start-cooking"
}
```
Step begins when manually triggered.

### Duration Types

#### 1. Fixed Duration
```json
{
  "type": "fixed",
  "seconds": 60
}
```
Step takes exactly 60 seconds.

#### 2. Variable Duration
```json
{
  "type": "variable",
  "minSeconds": 480,
  "maxSeconds": 720,
  "defaultSeconds": 600,
  "triggerName": "bacon-done"
}
```
Step duration varies based on conditions, with manual completion trigger.

#### 3. Time String Format
```json
{
  "type": "fixed",
  "timeString": "2m30s"
}
```
Duration specified as a human-readable time string.

## Resource Constraints

Resource constraints limit how many instances of a task can run simultaneously.

```json
{
  "resourceConstraints": [
    {
      "task": "stove-burner",
      "maxConcurrent": 4,
      "description": "Maximum number of stove burners that can be used simultaneously"
    },
    {
      "task": "toaster",
      "maxConcurrent": 2,
      "description": "Maximum number of toasters that can be used simultaneously"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Batch Processing with Staggering

```json
{
  "trackId": "toast",
  "name": "Toast",
  "description": "Multiple orders of toast",
  "batch_size": 4,
  "stagger": "30s",
  "steps": [
    {
      "stepId": "toast-cook",
      "name": "Make Toast",
      "description": "Place bread in toaster and toast until golden brown",
      "trigger": {
        "type": "programStartOffset",
        "offsetSeconds": 120
      },
      "duration": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "seconds": 210
      },
      "task": "toaster"
    }
  ]
}
```

This creates 4 toast orders, each starting 30 seconds after the previous one.

### Flexible Steps

```json
{
  "stepId": "wait-for-eggs",
  "name": "Wait for Eggs",
  "description": "Flexible waiting period while eggs cook",
  "task": "waiting",
  "trigger": {
    "on": "eggs-start-cooking"
  },
  "duration": {
    "type": "variable",
    "minSeconds": 0,
    "maxSeconds": 300,
    "defaultSeconds": 180
  },
  "flex": true
}
```

Flexible steps can expand or contract to fill available time gaps.

## Environment Integration

Programs can reference environment definitions that specify available resources and their capabilities.

```json
{
  "programId": "restaurant-breakfast",
  "name": "Restaurant Breakfast Service",
  "version": "0.1.0-alpha",
  "environmentType": "kitchen",
  "environment": "restaurant-standard.json"
}
```

## Validation

The schema enforces:

- Required fields are present
- Step dependencies are valid
- Resource constraints are reasonable
- Duration values are positive
- Track and step IDs are unique within their scope

## Migration Guide

### From Pre-Alpha to Alpha (0.1.0a1)

1. **Add version field** to all programs:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.1.0-alpha"
   }
   ```

2. **Update trigger syntax** (optional but recommended):
   - Old: `{"type": "afterStep", "stepId": "step-id"}`
   - New: `{"on": "step-id"}`

3. **Schema validation** now requires version field
